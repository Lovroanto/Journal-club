  "title": "Atomic electron transition",
  "content": "In atomic physics and chemistry, an atomic electron transition (also called an atomic transition, quantum jump, or quantum leap) is an electron changing from one energy level to another within an atom or artificial atom. The time scale of a quantum jump has not been measured experimentally. However, the Franck–Condon principle binds the upper limit of this parameter to the order of attoseconds.\nElectrons can relax into states of lower energy by emitting electromagnetic radiation in the form of a photon. Electrons can also absorb passing photons, which excites the electron into a state of higher energy. The larger the energy separation between the electron's initial and final state, the shorter the photons' wavelength.\n\n\n== History ==\nDanish physicist Niels Bohr first theorized that electrons can perform quantum jumps in 1913. Soon after, James Franck and Gustav Ludwig Hertz proved experimentally that atoms have quantized energy states.\nThe observability of quantum jumps was predicted by Hans Dehmelt in 1975, and they were first observed using trapped ions of barium at University of Hamburg and mercury at NIST in 1986.\n\n\n== Theory ==\nAn atom interacts with the oscillating electric field:\n\nwith amplitude \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          |\n        \n        \n          \n            \n              E\n            \n          \n          \n            0\n          \n        \n        \n          |\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle |{\\textbf {E}}_{0}|}\n  \n, angular frequency \n  \n    \n      \n        ω\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\omega }\n  \n, and polarization vector \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                \n                  e\n                \n                ^\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n              r\n              a\n              d\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\hat {\\textbf {e}}}_{\\mathrm {rad} }}\n  \n.

This is called the dipole approximation. The atom can also interact with the oscillating magnetic field produced by the radiation, although much more weakly.\nThe Hamiltonian for this interaction, analogous to the energy of a classical dipole in an electric field, is \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          H\n          \n            I\n          \n        \n        =\n        e\n        \n          \n            r\n          \n        \n        ⋅\n        \n          \n            E\n          \n        \n        (\n        t\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle H_{I}=e{\\textbf {r}}\\cdot {\\textbf {E}}(t)}\n  \n.

The angular integral is zero unless the selection rules for the atomic transition are satisfied.\n\n\n== Recent discoveries ==\nIn 2019, it was demonstrated in an experiment with a superconducting artificial atom consisting of two strongly-hybridized transmon qubits placed inside a readout resonator cavity at 15 mK, that the evolution of some jumps is continuous, coherent, deterministic, and reversible. On the other hand, other quantum jumps are inherently unpredictable.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nSchrödinger, Erwin (August 1952). \"Are there quantum jumps?
